# UniMiBike 2.0
This project had been made during the Internship we done at <b>University of Milan - Bicocca </b>, and it is also our bachelor thesis.
The University of Milan - Bicocca offers a bicycle rental service, also known as Bike Sharing. The service is free of charge to the dependents of university with a possible future 
extension to support all students. <br>

The bicycles will help the university staff to move from one building to another in a fast and comfortable manner. 
The mechanism of bike sharing is a necessary result, it is not indispensable, but the effect of it is 
effective due to the fact that it is poisoned at a distance that is not indifferent. <br>

Our work is consistent with the revision of an application, implemented in Flutter, that allows us to provide some 
functionality that can be considered as a possibility of having an accommodation and to show the list of racks and bicycles on a map. <br>

The current version adds to the system an administrative figure to guarantee the operation of other services that are not 
present in the Flutter version. To guarantee the operation of the application, the required functionality is necessary to
bring back-end modifications to the existing PHP application. They are still state-of-the-art, all new functionality that .
only the administrator has to follow. <br>

The application supportsnight mode and offers the possibility of having the language either in Italian or English, based on your device default settings. <br>
